We are Building a protocol in which Designers could create an NFT liquidity pool and the users who like the art could swap their coins with a fraction of the NFT making them the stakeholder of that particular NFT. Now when the Design is out in the market, the revenue generated through the sales will be piped back to the chain and will be distributed among the stakeholders using the concept of farming. This solves many problems the Designers face, like raising capital and generating revenue from their designs.

Tech Stack: Solidity, IPFS, Filecoin, NFT.storage, Polygon, ReactJS, Arcana, Hardhat, Tailwind, ethers.js

Use of IPFS and NFT.storage -
